# Project4-IGME230 Proposal, David Knolls

	My project idea is a simple game/simulation where the user can click to create various shapes, let go to drop them and have them
stack up. This would involve canvas to draw the shapes through clicking, an animation for the shapes to fall, some way of checking the
surrounding shapes for them to react in some way, and a way of stopping the game/simulation. This would also allow for various changes, as
I could use svg.js instead of canvas, and I could add in different abilities/reactions with the shapes. Another feature would be varying
color, and stacking shapes in some way could affect a score of some kind. This would feel more like a game, and could be one of my 3
iterations. These different aspects would allow me to create 3 different iterations of a shape creating and dropping simulation, and would
display multiple features and libraries such as svg.js, canvas, various animations and more!

I plan to work alone, and I want this grade to only count as my Project 4 grade.

To create this idea, Iâ€™ll need to continue to work with canvas and Javascript, svg.js, and multiple different animation libraries. I will
need to see how to work with collision between shapes, and how to detect things such as color and the shape. I will accomplish these skills
by working with canvas and svg.js more, continuing to look up Javascript tutorials, and overall practicing each skill within my project.
This will be a trial and error way of learning, and I may find myself needing other libraries to accomplish my goal.
