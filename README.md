# Project4-IGME230 Final Project, David Knolls

My final project is 3 iterations of a game, first showing the simple drop mechanics, second showing more variation and the start to collision removal, and third shows the complete game.
My project uses canvas to display the game and previous iterations, and javascript to manage everything and create user interactivity. SVG is als used at one instance, but I used an existing one and implemented it with canvas.

I worked alone on this project, and only wanted it to be used for my Project 4 grade.

# Technologies/Techniques Used:

The main technology I used was javascript, html, and css. Within javascript, I used canvas, svg, and default javascript. The javascript techniques I used were arrays, objects, and a lot of collision detection. This is very prevelant in the game, and it's mentioned multiple times. The html/css techniques I used involved using canvas, as well as style effects such as hover. The canvas techniques I used were creating rectangles, circles, and using paths to create lines and triangles. I also used canvas to draw images, and used javascript to move things in canvas.

# What I needed to learn:

I knew nothing about canvas going into this project, so I had to learn how it worked with creating shapes, dealing with events/triggers, and interactivity. This was also my first time making a game with javascript without jQuery, so I had to learn how to use javascript to make a game. Working with canvas to make a game was tricky, and even simple things as making a game loop was difficult until I learned about javascript's setInterval method. Overall, this game forced me to learn various aspects of javascript, as well as canvas and how to create an interactive experience.

# Above and Beyond:

Between all 3 iterations, I used canvas in a number of ways. For the first iteration, I primarily used canvas to create rectangles. For the second, I used canvas to create rectangles, paths, and images. Paths were used for creating lines, and images were created to display a svg image to represent a crane. For the third, I used canvas to do everything from the first 2, along with paths to create triangles.  Between all 3 iterations, I used functions such as listen handelers from canvas, setInterval from default javascript, and other functions I don't remember learning in class. Although arrays and objects were covered in class, I feel as if the collision I did were beyond what was covered.
