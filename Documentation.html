			<h2>
				Technologies/Techniques Used:
			</h2>
			<p>
				<br />
				The main technology I used was javascript, html, and css. Within javascript, I used canvas, svg, and default javascript.
				The javascript techniques I used were arrays, objects, and a lot of collision detection.
				This is very prevelant in the game, and it's mentioned multiple times.
				The html/css techniques I used involved using canvas, as well as style effects such as hover.
				The canvas techniques I used were creating rectangles, circles, and using paths to create lines and triangles.
				I also used canvas to draw images, and used javascript to move things in canvas.

			</p>
			<h2>
				What I needed to learn:
			</h2>
			<p>
				<br />
				I knew nothing about canvas going into this project, so I had to learn how it worked with creating shapes, dealing with events/triggers, and interactivity.
				This was also my first time making a game with javascript without jQuery, so I had to learn how to use javascript to make a game.
				Working with canvas to make a game was tricky, and even simple things as making a game loop was difficult until I learned about javascript's setInterval method.
				Overall, this game forced me to learn various aspects of javascript, as well as canvas and how to create an interactive experience. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Above and Beyond:
			</h2>
			<p>
				Between all 3 iterations, I used canvas in a number of ways.
				For the first iteration, I primarily used canvas to create rectangles.
				For the second, I used canvas to create rectangles, paths, and images.
				Paths were used for creating lines, and images were created to display a svg image to represent a crane.
				For the third, I used canvas to do everything from the first 2, along with paths to create triangles. 
				Between all 3 iterations, I used functions such as listen handelers from canvas, setInterval from default javascript, and other functions I don't remember learning in class.
				Although arrays and objects were covered in class, I feel as if the collision I did were beyond what was covered.
