				Iteration 1
			</h3>
			<p class="bodyText">
				<br />
				The first iteration of my project is a simulation for creating red squares.
				These red squares always drop from the top, fall, and either stack on the bottom or on top of other squares.
				There is also an option to reset the simulation so you can stack more squares.
				<br />
				<br />
				The point of this simulation is to set up the basic foundation for a game similar to tetris, but only using one shape at a time.
				This simulation uses canvas and javascript to function, and implements arrays and objects to check for collision.

			<h3>
				Iteration 2
			</h3>
			<p class="bodyText">
				<br />
				The second iteration of my project is a simulation for creating squares with random colors.
				These squares drop from the top, fall and stack on top of the ground and other squares.
				You are unable to drop more squares when the top is reached, and the only thing left to do is reset to start over.
				The varied colors allows for more comparisons to take place, and visually makes the simulation better to look at.
				A SVG Crane image is also added to show which column the squares are being dropped in, and moves with the mouse cursor.
				This is a quality of life improvement, and helps the user see where they are dropping squares at.
				This iteration also creates the first collsion that causes removal of squares.
				If 3 of the same color square are stacked on top of each other, they are all deleted. 
				<br />
				<br />
				The point of this simulation is to add onto the first iteration, allowing for more comparisons and the ability to randomize what is dropped.
				This simulation also uses canvas and javascript, as well as an svg image and text.
				Everything from iteration 1 is carried over and improved.
				Collision removal through javascript is also added for stacking.

			<h3>
				Iteration 3
			</h3>
			<p class="bodyText">
				The third iteration of my project turns the previous simulation into an actual game, featuring random shapes, colors, collision and matching betwen everything, a timer, score and ability to restart all within one window.
				New to this simulation is multiple shapes, including squares, triangles, and circles.
				All 3 of these shapes vary in color, and you can even see a preview of the current shape you are about to drop!
				There is also a timer that forces you to drop the shapes every 5 seconds, and a score to tell you how you did.
				A new mechanic ot this also is matching collision with the same shape and color, which works vertically, horizontal;y, and diaganolly.
				The reset button has also been changed to be within the game, instead of previously being outside of the game/simulation.
				<br />
				<br />
				This game features javascript, canvas, an svg image, text, collision detection, matching, adding/removing to arrays, and other unique features.
				Everything from iteration 1 and 2 was carried over, but much of it was changed and improved.
