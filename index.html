				Iteration 1
			</h3>
			<p class="bodyText">
				<br />
				The first iteration of my project is a simulation for creating red squares.
				These red squares always drop from the top, fall, and either stack on the bottom or on top of other squares.
				There is also an option to reset the simulation so you can stack more squares.
				<br />
				<br />
				The point of this simulation is to set up the basic foundation for a game similar to tetris, but only using one shape at a time.
				This simulation uses canvas and javascript to function, and implements arrays and objects to check for collision.

				Iteration 2

			<p class="bodyText">
				<br />
				The second iteration of my project is a simulation for creating squares with random colors.
				These squares drop from the top, fall and stack on top of the ground and other squares.
				You are unable to drop more squares when the top is reached, and the only thing left to do is reset to start over.
				The varied colors allows for more comparisons to take place, and visually makes the simulation better to look at.
				A SVG Crane image is also added to show which column the squares are being dropped in, and moves with the mouse cursor.
				This is a quality of life improvement, and helps the user see where they are dropping squares at.
				<br />
				<br />
				The point of this simulation is to add onto the first iteration, allowing for more comparisons and the ability to randomize what is dropped.
				This simulation also uses canvas and javascript, as well as an svg image and text.
				Everything from iteration 1 is carried over and improved.
